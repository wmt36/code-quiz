# code-quiz
This assignment has had me up on my toes as well as its taken over my dreams where i feel like i find the solution.

i was able to get to the point where my start quiz timer works and already have my first question appered by minuplating the DOM with javascrip but im not able to actually retrieve my other question and choices when i clcik on my next button. will continue to play with it and upload the revised version when i am able to debug my problem.
